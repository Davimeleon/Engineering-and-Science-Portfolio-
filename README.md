# David Bäcker-Peral – Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository highlights a selection of my most meaningful projects and research experiences, spanning independent engineering builds, neuroscience research, and applied machine learning. Each section includes links, media, and resources to explore the work in more detail.

## 1) Self-Moving Chessboard

**Description:**  
Inspired by Harry Potter, I built, designed, and programmed a self-moving chessboard from scratch. The project uses a **CoreXY architecture**, **Arduino microcontrollers**, and **electromagnets** to move chess pieces automatically. I integrated sensors to track piece positions, as well as speech recognition and voice feedback to allow completely hands-free play.

- **Skills Applied:** Arduino (C++), electromagnetics, soldering, CAD, embedded systems, CoreXY motion control

## 2) Caltech Neuroscience Research

**Description:**  
As a research intern at **Caltech’s Anderson Lab (Chen Institute of Neuroscience)**, I investigated the physiological correlates of emotional states in mice. I programmed a **thermography camera**, developed CAD hardware, and ran experiments studying how optogenetic stimulation of aggression or fear affected thermoregulatory responses. My independent work revealed a novel correlation between aggression and body temperature, validating the expression “hot-headed.”

## 3) Yale Research

**Description:**  
At Yale, I’ve been involved in two major research directions:  

1. **Saxena Lab – Wu Tsai Undergraduate Fellow**  
   - Utilizing **multi-agent reinforcement learning** to model cooperative behavior in rats.  
   - Research explores the effects of early-life stress on social cooperation.  
   - **GitHub:** [A Computational Framework for Studying Social Cooperation in Rats](https://github.com/Davimeleon/A-Computational-Framework-for-Studying-Social-Cooperation-in-Rats)  

2. **Geiller Lab – Virtual Reality Research**  
   - Built and coded a **VR environment for mice** to compare behavioral performance across real-world and virtual tasks.

## 4) NASA Deep Learning & Microgravity Research

**Description:**  
Through NASA’s **STEM Enhancement in Earth Science (SEES)** program, I contributed to two separate research initiatives:  

1. **Microgravity Experiments (2023):**  
   - Built and launched Twigg’s Labs **Zqubes** to test light refraction in microgravity aboard a reduced-gravity aircraft.  

2. **Deep Learning for Mosquito Classification (2022):**  
   - Applied **CNN and ViT architectures** to classify mosquito larvae, comparing accuracy and computational performance.  
   - Co-authored a peer-reviewed preprint cited 5+ times.  

- **Publication:** [A Mosquito is Worth 16x16 Larvae (arXiv)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.07718)
